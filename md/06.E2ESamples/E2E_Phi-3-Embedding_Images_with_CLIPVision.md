# Using the CLIPVisionModel to process images and generate image embeddings with Phi-3-vision

The following python sample provides the necessary functionality to process images and generate image embeddings using the CLIPVisionModel.

## What is CLIP
CLIP, which stands for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training, is a model developed by OpenAI that efficiently learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. It’s a multimodal model that combines image and text understanding in a single framework. CLIP is trained on a variety of internet-sourced images and the text found with them, learning to predict which images were paired with which texts, effectively linking the two modalities.

The model works by taking an image and a text snippet as input and then predicting the likelihood that the text is an accurate description of the image. This approach allows CLIP to handle a wide range of visual tasks, such as object recognition, classification, and even generating descriptions for images it has never seen before.

One of the key advantages of CLIP is its ability to perform “zero-shot” learning, where the model can correctly handle tasks it wasn’t explicitly trained for, simply by reading the description of the task. This is possible because of the vast amount of diverse data it has been trained on, which helps it generalize well to new tasks.

## Phi-3-vision
Phi-3-vision is a 4.2B parameter multimodal model with language and vision capabilities, capable of reasoning over real-world images and digital documents, extracting and reasoning over text from images, and generating insights and answers related to charts or diagrams

**Example Purpose:** This example demonstrates generating image embeddings using CLIP and how it can be applied to tasks related to the Phi-3 model. It serves as a reference for comparing the performance and characteristics of different embedding techniques (CLIP vs. Phi-3).
**Integration Challenge:** Integrating another vision encoder like CLIP directly into Phi-3 is indeed complex. This complexity arises due to architectural differences and the need for seamless integration without losing context or performance. Integration hasn't been fully evaluated or implemented yet so this included.
**Comparison Approach:** The code aims to provide a parallel comparison rather than an integrated solution. It allows users to see how CLIP embeddings perform alongside Phi-3 embeddings, providing insights into potential benefits or drawbacks.
**Clarification:** This Phi-3CookBook Example: Showcases how to use CLIP embeddings as a comparative tool rather than a direct integration into Phi-3.
**Integration Work:** Full integration of CLIP embeddings into Phi-3 remains a challenge and has not been fully explored but its there for customer to experiment.

## Sample Code
This code defines a class called Phi3ImageEmbedding that represents an image embedding model. The purpose of this class is to process images and generate embeddings that can be used for downstream tasks such as image classification or retrieval.

The __init__ method initializes the model by setting up various components such as embedding dropout, image processor, HD transform parameters, and image projection. It takes a config object as input, which contains configuration parameters for the model. The wte parameter is an optional input that represents word token embeddings.

The get_img_features method takes an input tensor img_embeds representing image embeddings and returns a tensor representing the extracted image features. It uses the img_processor to process the image embeddings and extract the desired features based on the layer_idx and type_feature parameters.

## Explain the Code
Let's go through the code step by step:

The code imports necessary libraries and modules, including math, torch, torch.nn, and various components from the transformers library.

The code defines a configuration object called CLIP_VIT_LARGE_PATCH14_336_CONFIG that contains various hyperparameters for the image embedding model.

The Phi3ImageEmbedding class is defined, which is a subclass of torch.nn.Module. This class represents the image embedding model and contains methods for forward propagation and setting image features.

The __init__ method initializes the Phi3ImageEmbedding object. It takes a config object as input, which is an instance of PretrainedConfig class. It also takes an optional wte argument.

The __init__ method initializes various attributes of the Phi3ImageEmbedding object based on the provided config object. It sets the hidden size, dropout rate, image processor, image projection, and other parameters.

The set_img_features method sets the image features for the model. It takes a tensor of image features as input and assigns it to the img_features attribute of the object.

The set_img_sizes method sets the image sizes for the model. It takes a tensor of image sizes as input and assigns it to the img_sizes attribute of the object.

The get_img_features method extracts image features from the input image embeddings. It takes a tensor of image embeddings as input and returns the extracted image features.

The forward method performs forward propagation through the model. It takes input IDs, pixel values, and image sizes as input and returns the hidden states of the model. It first checks if image features and sizes are already set, and if not, it uses the provided input to set them. Then, it processes the input IDs and extracts image features based on the configured image processor. Finally, it applies the image projection to the extracted features and returns the hidden states.

Overall, this code defines a class that represents an image embedding model and provides methods for setting image features and performing forward propagation.

## Building your Pipeline

Working with code that generates embeddings, such as the example above, you typically integrate it into your pipeline depending on your specific use case.
 
1. Loading Pre-trained Models: If you're loading pre-trained models from Hugging Face, these models are indeed binary. You can use them directly for generating embeddings without additional training. This is useful for tasks like feature extraction or semantic search where you need embeddings out-of-the-box.
 
2. Fine-Tuning Pipeline: If you need to adapt the model to a specific task or dataset, you would integrate the code into a fine-tuning pipeline. This involves:
   - Loading the Pre-trained Model: Start with a pre-trained model from Hugging Face.
   - Preparing Your Dataset: Ensure your dataset is in the correct format for training.
   - Fine-Tuning: Use libraries like `transformers` and `datasets` from Hugging Face to fine-tune the model on your dataset. This step adjusts the model weights to better suit your specific task.
 
For example, in the context of the Phi-3 Cookbook and CLIPVision, you might:
- Generate Embeddings: Use the pre-trained CLIP model to generate embeddings for images.
- Fine-Tune: If the embeddings need to be more specific to your application, fine-tune the CLIP model on a dataset relevant to your use case.
 
Here's a simplified example of how you might integrate this in code:
 
```python
from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
 
# Load pre-trained model and processor
model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Prepare your data
images = [...]  # List of images
inputs = processor(images=images, return_tensors="pt")
 
# Generate embeddings
with torch.no_grad():
    embeddings = model.get_image_features(**inputs)
 
# Fine-tuning (if needed)
# Define your fine-tuning logic here
```
 
This approach allows you to leverage powerful pre-trained models and adapt them to your specific needs.

## Integrating the Phi Family of Models

Integrating the Phi-3 model with the provided code example involving CLIP can indeed be challenging, especially when considering different vision encoders. 
 
Here's a brief overview of how you might approach this:
 
### Key Points
**Data Processing:** Ensure that the images are processed in a way that fits the input requirements of the Phi-3 model.
**Embedding Generation:** Replace the CLIP embedding generation with the corresponding method from your Phi-3 model.
**Fine-Tuning:** If you need to fine-tune the Phi-3 model, ensure the logic is included after generating the embeddings.

## Steps to Integrate Phi-3 Model
**Load the Phi-3 Model:** Assuming you have a Phi3Model class for the vanilla or fine-tuned Phi-3 model.
**Modify the Data Preparation:** Adjust the data preparation to suit the input requirements of the Phi-3 model.
**Integrate Phi-3 Embeddings:** Replace the part where CLIP embeddings are generated with the Phi-3 model's embedding generation.

```
from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel
import torch
 
# Load pre-trained CLIP model and processor
clip_model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
clip_processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
 
# Load Phi-3 model (vanilla or fine-tuned)
# Assuming you have a load_phi3_model function to load your Phi-3 model
phi3_model = load_phi3_model(fine_tuned=True)
 
# Prepare your data
images = [...]  # List of images
inputs = clip_processor(images=images, return_tensors="pt")
 
# Generate embeddings using CLIP (for comparison)
with torch.no_grad():
    clip_embeddings = clip_model.get_image_features(**inputs)
 
# Generate embeddings using Phi-3
# Adjust this part according to how your Phi-3 model processes inputs
phi3_inputs = process_for_phi3_model(images)
with torch.no_grad():
    phi3_embeddings = phi3_model.get_image_features(phi3_inputs)
 
# Fine-tuning or further processing (if needed)
# Define your fine-tuning logic here
